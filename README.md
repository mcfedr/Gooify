# Gooify

Gooify is a simple program that finds all of the music in your Google Play Music library and adds it to your Spotify library. It has two options: to copy your entire library to Spotify or to copy all playlists to Spotify.

This modified version from the [original](https://github.com/gzinck/Gooify) will just add your albums from google music to spotify. 

## Guide

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- cp .env.dist .env
- Add your [spotify client info](https://developer.spotify.com/) to .env and set your usernames
- python main.py
- Boom!
- Otherwise check out the code, there is a bit of a mess, but should easy to modify and do what you want with.
